# Jiggle

Jiggle is a Gnome Shell extension that highlights the cursor position when the mouse is moved rapidly.

## Known Issues

* Detecting mouse clicks/active windows isn't as straightforward as one would believe.
* Getting a higher quality system cursor image isn't either.

Patches welcome.

### Anatomy Of An Effect

Jiggle effects use duck typing, and effects are expected to have the following methods:

| Method | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `render()` | Executed in a timed loop, for repainting the screen. |
| `run(x, y)` | Executed when the cursor moves, with the x and y screen coordinates. |
| `start()` | Executed when jiggling is first detected. |
| `stop()` | Executed when jiggling is no longer detected. |
| `update(settings)` | Executed if any of the preferences are changed. `settings` is a `Gio.Settings` instance. |

### Building

Tools required:

* GNU make
* docker
* bash
* glib-compile-schemas
* glade

```bash
make
```

### Recompiling the Settings Schema and Preferences UI

Any changes to the settings or UI xml will require recompilation.

**DO NOT** edit [ui/gtk4.ui](ui/gtk4.ui) directly, as it is generated from [ui/gtk3.ui](ui/gtk3.ui)!!!

```bash
make compile
```

### Testing

Tests use [GjsUnit](https://github.com/romu70/GjsUnit/), which is included here.

```bash
make test
```

### Docker Testing

Multiple systems can be tested via Docker:

```bash
make docker
```

Or, test a single system:

```bash
make docker_centos
make docker_debian
```
